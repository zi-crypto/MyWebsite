### ðŸ§  Ziad Amerâ€™s Journey at Mazaady â€“ Summary for Context

Ziad Amer joined **Mazaady** in **May 2025** as a **Part-Time R\&D Machine Learning Specialist**, while still a student at FCAI Cairo University. Although his *official role* involved generating **3 research-based ML ideas per week**, he went above and beyond by proactively developing a full ML project without being directly assigned to do so.

Key contributions included:

* Fine-tuning a machine learning model with performance in mind
* Dockerizing the entire solution for production readiness
* Ensuring itâ€™s lightweight, fast, and suitable for mobile use
* Creating clear, professional API documentation
* Completing the project independently in his *spare time*, purely driven by excitement and value creation

Despite his fatherâ€™s caution about overdelivering early on, Ziad sees his role as a chance to **provide more value than expected**, set a strong example, and learn deeply. His work ethic is rooted in anticipation, autonomy, and building for long-term impact â€” even if certain deliverables havenâ€™t been "formally" requested yet.

The company's team has been respectful of Ziad's student status and has not crossed any professional boundaries. This is Ziad's **first official job**, and heâ€™s approaching it with a mixture of humility, eagerness, and strategic thinking.

Expected duration of this part-time role is **around 3 months**.
